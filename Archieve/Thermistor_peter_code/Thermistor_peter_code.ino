/*  Thermistor temperature sensor demonstration sketch

 * 

 * This sketch calculates the the temperature by reading the voltage of a 

 * thermistor connected in a voltage divider circuit.

 * 

 * It then does a caclulation to convert this raw reading into a temperature.

 * 

 * This sketch was adapted for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris from the 

 * demo sketch that ships with the library, written by Daniel Berenguer.

 * 

 * Components

 * ----------

 *  - Arduino Uno

 *  - thermistor temperature sensor

 *  - 10 kOhm resistor

 *  

 *  Libraries

 *  ---------

 *  Thermistor.h

 *

 * Connections

 * -----------

 * 

 * Connect the Arduino 5V pin to one end of the

 * thermistor. Connect the resistor to the Arduino GND

 * pin. Connect the free pins on the thermistor and 

 * resistor together. Connect the thermistor and resistor

 * junction to the Arduino analog pin 0. This

 * structure is called a "voltage divider".

 *                    10 kΩ

 *  5V -----OOO------\/\/\/-----GND
