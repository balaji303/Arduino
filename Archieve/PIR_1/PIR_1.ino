/*  Infrred sensor demo sketch

 * 

 * This sketch demonstrates the use of the PIR infrared motion sensor.

 * 

 * The sketch adds to the bare minimum version by allowing extra time 

 * after the sensor goes LOW for the LED to remain HIGH. This could be 

 * useful in a scenario where you want a light to go on in a room when 

 * someone enters it, but to turn of a few minutes after they leave it.

 * 

 * This sketch was adapted from the original that comes with the 

 * Adafruit library for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris.

 * 

* Components

 * ----------

 *  - Arduino Uno

 *  - Infrared motion sensor

 *  - An LED

 *  - A 220 Ohm resistor for the LEd

 *  

 *  Libraries

 *  ---------

 *  - None

 *

 * Connections

 * -----------

 *  Break out    |    Arduino Uno

 *  -----------------------------

 *      VCC      |      5V

 *      GND      |      GND

 *      OUT      |      4

 *      

 * Also connect an LED to simulate a controlled device. 

 *           220 Ohm

 *    3 ----/\/\/\/\----(LED |)----GND
