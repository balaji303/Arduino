# TCS3200-ColorSensor
TCS3200 - Color Sensor 


	TCS3200 is a library for color detection with TCS3200 module.

	The main objective is improve the performance detection of differente range colors
	for simple robotic applications.

	
		Compute time event intervals to read input signal for non-blocking systems.
		Compute buffer based on mean values and filtering errors.
		Mapping in different range values for colors.
		EEPROM memory for save some calibration data and color list.
		Remote Calibration with Bluetooth Devices adapted with SoftwareSerial
		Remote Calibration with Bluetooth Devices adapted with HardwareSerial for MEGA
		Assign interruption pin to the INPUT signal to calculate samples. (WIP)
