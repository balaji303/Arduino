/*  LCD screen demo sketch

 * 

 * This sketch shows you how to use the 16x2 LCD display in

 * 4-bit mode with the Arduino Uno.

 * 

 * The LiquidCrystal

 * library works with all LCD displays that are compatible with the 

 * Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you

 * can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface.

 * 

 * Components

 * ----------

 *  - Arduino Uno

 *  - 10KOhm potentiometer

 *  - jumper wires

 *  - Breadboard

 *  

 *  Libraries

 *  ---------

 *  - LiquidCrystal (comes with Arduino IDE)

 *

 * Connections

 * -----------

 *  LCD screen    |    Arduino Uno

 *  -----------------------------

 *      1  (Vss)  |      GND

 *      2  (Vdd)  |      5V

 *      3  (VO)   |      Potentiometer

 *      4  (RS)   |      12

 *      5  (RW)   |      GND

 *      6  (E)    |      11

 *      7  (D0)   |      Not connected

 *      8  (D1)   |      Not connected

 *      9  (D2)   |      Not connected

 *      10 (D3)   |      Not connected

 *      11 (D4)   |      5

 *      12 (D5)   |      4

 *      13 (D6)   |      3

 *      14 (D7)   |      2

 *      15 (A)    |      5V

 *      16 (K)    |      GND

 *      

 * For the potentiometer, connect the middle pin

 * to pin 3 (V0) of the display. The other two, connect

 * to 5V and GND. It doesn't matter which pin goes to

 * 5V and to GND.

// include the library code:

#include <LiquidCrystal.h>



// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins

LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);



void setup() {

  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows: 

  lcd.begin(16, 2);

  // Print a message to the LCD.

  lcd.print("hello, world!");

}



void loop() {

  // set the cursor to column 0, line 1

  // (note: line 1 is the second row, since counting begins with 0):

  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);

  // print the number of seconds since reset:

  lcd.print(millis()/1000);

}
