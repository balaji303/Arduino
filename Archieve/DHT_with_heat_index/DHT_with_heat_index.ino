/*  DHT22/11 temerature and humidity sensor demonstration sketch

 * 

 * This sketch reads the temperature and humidity from a DHT sensor.

 * 

 * This is a common digital sensor which is calibrated in factory

 * and outputs true values so that no further calculations are needed

 * on the Arduino.



 * 

 * This sketch was adapted for Arduino Step by Step by Peter Dalmaris from the 

 * demo sketch that ships with the Adafruit library.

 * 

 * Components

 * ----------

 *  - Arduino Uno

 *  - A DHT22 or DHT11 sensor

 *  - 10 kOhm resistor to pull up the data pin

 *  

 *  Libraries

 *  ---------

 *  DHT.h

 *

 * Connections

 * -----------

 * 

 * Hold the sensor so that the grill is towards you. Here are the connections

 * Connect a 10KOhm resistor between the 5V and data pin (2)
